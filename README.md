This app is a music player capable of playing music from 2 sources:
- SoundCloud: Songs can be searched for by tag or keyword, and then streamed
- User's music: Music that is stored on the user's device can be browsed and played

Additionally, a playlist of local favourite songs can be created, and the user can log in to the app to back up the same to the cloud.
